## 📖 About The Project

This repository contains the analysis pipeline and preprocessed data for the upcoming paper:  
**Schmidt, Visser, Maurits & Thiele et al. (in prep).**

In the spirit of **Open Science**, the primary goal of this repository is to make our analysis fully transparent and reproducible. The project investigates eye-tracking data quality across different human (4-, 6-, 9-, 18-month-olds, and adults) and non-human (chimpanzees) samplesthrough three distinct experiments:
* **Experiment 1:** Includes chimpanzee (`chimp`) and human (`human`) samples.  
RQ1: (How) Does Eye-Tracking Data Quality Vary Within and Between Groups?  
RQ2: (How) Does Eye-Tracking Data Quality Change Over Time?  
RQ3: Are Eye-Tracking Outcomes Confounded With Data Quality?  
* **Experiment 2:** Includes chimpanzee (`chimp`) sample only.  
RQ4: Can Modifications in the Calibration Procedure Improve Eye-Tracking Data Quality in Chimpanzees?  
* **Experiment 3:** Includes infant (`infant`) samples only.  
RQ5: Can Modifications in the Calibration Procedure Improve Eye-Tracking Data Quality in Human Infants?  

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is structured by experiment. Each experiment folder (`exp1`, `exp2`, `exp3`) acts as a self-contained environment containing its respective scripts, helper functions, data, documentation, and plots.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

This project was developed using **R 4.5.1** and uses **renv** for dependency management.

After cloning the repository, restore the project environment:

```r
renv::restore()
```

### Reproducing the Main Analyses

The repository contains preprocessed datasets that allow users to reproduce the inferential analyses reported in the manuscript without starting from the raw eye-tracking data.

To reproduce the statistical analyses, run the corresponding analysis scripts within each experiment folder.

### Reproducing the Complete Data Processing Pipeline

To reproduce all preprocessing and analysis steps from the raw eye-tracking data, first download the raw datasets from the linked OSF project.

The downloaded files must be placed into the appropriate `data` directories before running the analysis pipeline.

└── preproc/

```

### Running the Pipeline

Within each experiment, scripts should be executed sequentially according to their numbering:

```text
0_*   Initial preprocessing / data preparation
1_*   Data cleaning
2_*   Blink detection
3_*   Variable computation
```

For example:

```text
exp1_human_0_anonymize_data.R
exp1_human_1_clean_data.R
exp1_human_2_detect_blinks.R
exp1_human_3_compute_variables.R
```

The same principle applies to all experiment-specific pipelines.
