# eyetracking-quality-devcomp

⚠️ **Status:** This project is a work in progress.

## General information
This project investigates eye-tracking data quality in developmental and comparative research. 👶🐒  
To this end, we ran three experiments (`exp1`, `exp2`, `exp3`). For each experiment, we provide
- anonymized raw data (`expn/data/raw_public/...`)
- preprocessed data (`expn/data/tbc/...`)
- (tbc)

The full R package environment (including version numbers) is recorded in `renv.lock`.

This research project was preregistered on the Open Science Framework (OSF):
